ckgedit is a WYSIWYG editor for Dokuwiki.  It is an implementation of fckgLite which replaces the
FCKEditor with the more current CKEditor. Whereas the base directory for fckgLite is named fckg, the 
base directory for this version is ckgedit. However, at the present time, only one of the two can
be enabled at any one time.  fckgLite has had thousands of users and downlaods and has been
in development for 4 years. While ckgedit takes great advantage of this development history,
it may be missing a few features which are available in fckgLite and will be added in 
due course.  For details on these, see the fckgLite web site, fckgLite dailies page, or the ckgedit
plugin page at Dokuwiki.org.

This version of ckgeditor should work with Linux, Windows, and versions of Dokuwiki installed with the 
Ubuntu/Debian package manager.

This version of ckgedit uses CKEditor 4.2.2
